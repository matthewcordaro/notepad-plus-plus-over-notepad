# Notepad++ Over Notepad
A Powershell Script that replaces notepad with notepad++ for the default editor.

1.  Download and install [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/).
1.  Open a PowerShell console in Administrator mode. You can find the PowerShell console by clicking on the start button and typing powershell then ctrl-shift-enter.
1.  From within the console, navigate to the folder containing the script.
1.  Make sure your computer can run scripts by setting a proper Execution Policy. You'll need to _briefly_ read up on execution policys on [MS TechNet](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176961.aspx). I recommend _RemoteSigned_.
1.  Lastly, run the script!


You can use the same instructions to undo the install with the undo script.!
